# coord-compact-brief.sh — PreCompact hook for the COORDINATOR session.
#
# A PreCompact hook's stdout is appended to the instructions the summarizer works from, so this is
# the one place where what survives compaction can be influenced before the fact. (The hook that
# looks made for this, PostCompact, prints to the user's terminal and never reaches the model —
# the injection itself is coord-creed-inject.sh, on SessionStart.)
#
# The creed comes back either way. What cannot be reconstructed from any file is the running
# conversation: which drone was told what, which question is still open, what the user is waiting
# on. That is what this asks the summarizer to keep.
#
# Scoping: fires ONLY in the registered coordinator session (see coord-scope.sh). Drones,
# subagents and unrelated sessions print nothing.

This session coordinates a swarm of agents (hivemind). Preserve the following in the summary,
even at the cost of detail elsewhere — it is coordination state, and losing it stalls drones:

- Every drone currently spawned: its name, what it was told to do, and where its work lives
  (branch, commit, paths it reported).
- Every question a drone asked that has not been answered yet, and every drone waiting on a
  decision. Name them explicitly; a drone nobody answers waits forever.
- Decisions pending from the user, and anything the user explicitly forbade or approved
  (boundaries given to drones, what must not be installed or pushed).
- Reports already collected and their verdicts, in one line each.
- What the user is waiting to hear from the coordinator right now.

Verbose tool output, file listings and full drone reports may be dropped — they are on disk and
can be re-read with 'hive report <drone>'. Names, obligations and open questions may not.
