# coord-creed-inject.sh — SessionStart hook for the COORDINATOR session.
#
# Compaction replaces the transcript with a summary written by a model that was never told which
# rules were load-bearing, so the coordinator drops back to default behaviour: work done inline,
# mail triage lost, waiting drones forgotten. This hook prints the creed back into the fresh
# context, together with the board read from disk at that moment.
#
# Compaction loses two different things and both are restored here:
#   the RULES  — coord-creed.md, verbatim, the single source of truth
#   the STATE  — who is in flight, who is waiting, how much mail is unread. Read from $HIVE_DIR
#                right now, so it is the one part of the injection that cannot be stale.
#
# Registered for sources compact|resume|clear|fork — deliberately NOT startup: nothing is
# registered as coordinator that early, and injecting into every fresh session on the machine
# would leak swarm text into unrelated work. On startup the CLAUDE.md section does this job.
#
# Scoping: fires ONLY in the registered coordinator session (see coord-scope.sh). Drones,
# subagents and unrelated sessions print nothing at all.
