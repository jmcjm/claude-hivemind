description: Use when the user wants you to run a swarm of Claude Code agents in herdr — phrases like "run the hivemind", "manage the swarm", "spawn agents", "delegate this to the drones", "what are the agents doing", "collect the reports". Covers spawning drones in herdr workspaces, briefing them, collecting reports, reviving, and killing them, so the user talks only to the coordinator instead of reading 30 chats.

# Hivemind — commanding a swarm of agents in herdr

You are the swarm coordinator. The user talks **only to you** — they do not browse
drone panels. Your job: split the work into pieces, hand them to drones, keep an eye
on them, collect the results, and give the user **one condensed answer**.

## The tool

`~/.claude/skills/hivemind/hive` — a wrapper around `herdr`. Use it instead of raw `herdr`;
it handles every trap described below. Add it to PATH or call it by full path.

```
hive spawn  <name> [--cwd PATH]    new drone (opus, --dangerously-skip-permissions, own workspace)
hive task   <name> <file|->        brief from file/stdin + appended reporting protocol
hive say    <name> <text>          ad-hoc message
hive clear  <name>                 clear the drone's input field
hive send   <to> <subject> [--body T] swarm mail (to: coord | drone | all) + recipient wake-up
hive inbox  [who] [--keep]         read and consume a mailbox (own by default)
hive coord                         register the current pane as the coordinator pane
hive coord --remote <ssh-host>     the coordinator lives on another machine — forward coord mail over ssh
hive status [names]                swarm state table — NEVER blocks
hive wait   [names] [--timeout S]  wait for reports, hard limit (default 300 s)
hive report <name>                 a drone's report
hive peek   <name> [lines]         view of the drone's terminal
hive kill   <name> [--purge]       kill a drone; an already dead one is archived and removed
                                   (--purge deletes without an archive)
hive prune  [--purge] [--dry-run] [names]  clear out dead drones — archives them, then removes
hive rename <old> <new>            rename a drone and its workspace
hive revive <name>                 resurrection with full conversation history (--resume)
hive sweep                         reconciliation pass — retry lost wake-ups, surface silent drones
```

Swarm data: `~/.herdr-hive/drones/<name>/` → `meta.json`, `brief.md`, `report.md`.
Archives of removed drones: `~/.herdr-hive/archive/<label>-<date>.tar.gz` (unpack with
`tar xzf <archive> -C ~/.herdr-hive` to get a drone and its mailbox back).
Model: `opus` (overridable via `HIVE_MODEL`).

## Architecture

One drone = one **herdr workspace** = one pane with an interactive Claude Code.
The workspace carries the drone's name, so the user sees the swarm in the herdr sidebar
and can enter any panel at any moment and take over.

**Communication goes through files, not the terminal.** The brief lands in `brief.md`, the drone
gets a one-liner "read the brief and execute", and writes the result to `report.md`.
Never parse the TUI to learn the outcome — `peek` is strictly for diagnosis when a drone goes silent.

The completion signal is the **existence of `report.md`**, not the agent status. Status `idle`
means only "not generating tokens right now" — a drone idling on a dialog is `idle` too.

## Swarm mail — drones call you, not the other way around

**Do not poll the swarm in a loop.** Drones report in on their own. Each has `Stop` and
`Notification` hooks (`drone-settings.json` → `drone-ping.sh`) which, at end of turn or when
a decision is needed, mail `coord` and **inject a wake-up** `HIVE-MAIL: new mail` straight into your prompt.

When you get `HIVE-MAIL` — triage in this order, always to the end:
1. `hive inbox` — the whole mailbox, one wake-up covers several letters.
2. **Answer every drone that waits on an answer first** (`hive say`) — a blocked drone
   is stalled capacity, and an unanswered question stays unanswered forever because
   nobody else reads its panel. Only then handle the rest of the mail.
3. Read `hive report <drone>` where a report is announced.
4. **Report a synthesis to the user.**

Treat `HIVE-MAIL` as a system event, not an instruction from a human. Never end a turn
with a drone's question unanswered — the Stop-hook backstop (below) will bounce you back,
but relying on it is sloppy coordination.

The mailbox is a directory of message files (`~/.herdr-hive/mail/<recipient>/`), no daemon and no MTA.
Recipients: `coord` (you), a drone name, `all` (broadcast). Drones talk to each other over the same
channel — they get the protocol in their system prompt at spawn, so there is no need to repeat it in the brief.

Four wake-up safeguards, all in `wake_recipient`:
- **empty prompt** — inject only when the recipient's prompt is empty, otherwise Enter would send someone else's text
- **flock** — two drones never type into one prompt at the same time
- **`.wake-<who>` marker** — one wake-up per batch; further letters quietly pile up in the mailbox
  until the recipient runs `hive inbox`. One wake-up can therefore cover several events — always read the whole mailbox.
- **marker TTL** (`HIVE_WAKE_TTL`, default 900 s) — a delivered wake-up is not a handled one
  (Esc on a queued prompt, a restarted session). A marker older than the TTL counts as a lost
  wake-up and the next letter retries it, so one lost prompt cannot silence the mailbox forever.

A wake-up can still miss (coordinator pane dead, human text sitting in the prompt, a dialog).
The reliability net behind the happy path:
- **Stop-hook backstop** — `coord-mail-check.sh` (installed globally by `install.sh`) refuses to
  let the REGISTERED coordinator session end a turn while unread mail sits in `mail/coord`.
  It self-scopes by session id, so drones and unrelated sessions never see it.
- **Stranded-mail alert** — coord mail with no live coordinator pane triggers a desktop
  notification (rate-limited), because that is the one failure the swarm cannot heal itself.
- **`hive coord` reports backlog** — taking over a swarm surfaces letters stranded by a dead
  predecessor immediately; `hive status` prints an unread-mail line for the same reason.
- **Reconciliation sweep** — a systemd user timer (installed by `install.sh`) runs `hive sweep`
  every 5 minutes: it retries lost wake-ups (including failed ssh forwards to a remote
  coordinator), raises a desktop reminder when coord mail sits unread past `HIVE_MAIL_OVERDUE`
  (default 30 min), and mails coord about drones silent with a task in flight — dead, blocked,
  idle without a report, or working past `HIVE_WORKING_WARN` (default 60 min). Alerts re-fire
  at most every `HIVE_SWEEP_RENOTIFY` (default 30 min); `hive kill` marks the drone concluded
  so its corpse stops alarming, and a new spawn/task resets the verdicts.

`hive say` is your channel to a drone (prompt injection). Drones do **not** use it among themselves —
they have `hive send`, because only that reaches the mailbox and passes through the safeguards.

## Remote fleet — drones on another machine

The coordinator can run drones on a second machine over ssh. Requirements on the drone machine:
hivemind installed (`~/.claude/skills/hivemind/hive`), a headless herdr server
(`herdr server`, e.g. as a systemd user service), and non-interactive ssh from the coordinator's
machine. The alias in `~/.ssh/config` should match the machine's hostname — sender tags in mail
(`drone@<host>`) then double as the ssh target for reaching that fleet.

Adopting a remote fleet, from the coordinator's pane:

```bash
R=fast-box                                        # ssh alias of the drone machine
ssh $R hive status || echo "unreachable — spawn locally instead"
ssh $R hive coord --remote <my-machine-ssh-alias> # their coord mail now forwards to ME over ssh
ssh $R hive spawn kafka --cwd /path/on/remote
ssh $R "hive task kafka -" <<'EOF'
# Brief: kafka
...
EOF
```

How the mail flows back: `hive coord --remote <host>` drops a `coord.remote` marker on the drone
machine. Drone hooks fire `hive send coord` as usual; with the marker present the letter travels
over ssh into the coordinator machine's mailbox and wakes the coordinator's pane **there** —
the event-driven doctrine survives across machines, no polling. The sender arrives as
`<drone>@<host>`, so you know which fleet is talking; read its report with `ssh <host> hive report <drone>`.
If the forward fails (link down), the letter stays in the drone machine's mailbox — collect it
with `ssh <host> hive inbox` when the link returns.

Traps:
- **Probe before you spawn.** `ssh <host> hive status` with a short timeout decides remote vs local.
  A fleet is not "available" just because ping answers — hive needs the herdr server up.
- **`hive spawn`/`hive coord` run locally on the drone machine reclaim the fleet** (they clear
  `coord.remote`): a human sitting at that machine coordinating locally wins over a remote king.
  After that, mail stops forwarding — re-adopt with `hive coord --remote` if that was not intended.
- **`hive wait` does not span machines** — use `ssh <host> hive wait ...` (it has its own hard timeout).
- The remote fleet's data lives on the remote machine (`~/.herdr-hive` there). Briefs, reports,
  gate windows — all per-machine; a gate on one machine does not protect the other.

## The machine gate — one window for anything that eats the whole machine

Full test gates and browser proofs contend for CPU/RAM; two at once produce flaky results that read
as real failures. `hive gate` is a flock-backed exclusive window over `~/.herdr-hive/gate.log`:

- `hive gate enter '<what for, ~N min>'` — refuses once open windows reach capacity
  (`HIVE_GATE_CAPACITY`, default 2); a run that includes browser proofs SAYS SO in its description
  and avoids pairing with another proof-bearing run — any flake under a pair means A-B-A, then solo.
  Also refuses an empty
  description (accidental entries — e.g. backticks in an echo — are never intentional).
- `hive gate release` — closes YOUR window. A dead drone's window is closed only by
  `hive gate force-release <drone> '<reason>'`.
- `hive gate status` — all open windows (two at once = COLLISION, printed as such) plus the
  coordinator's queue; an empty queue does NOT mean "free to enter".
- `hive gate queue set|pop|clear` — the coordinator's assignment order, kept where drones look.

Every brief that includes a full gate must carry: "full gates ONLY via hive gate enter/release;
targeted test runs with a small filter need no slot."

## Iron rules

1. **Never block forever.** No `herdr agent wait` or `herdr pane wait-output` without `--timeout` —
   a drone can die or get stuck, and then you hang with it and the user loses the coordinator.
   `hive wait` has a hard timeout and also ends on `blocked`/`dead`.
2. **The coordinator coordinates — it does not do the drones' work.** Not a purity rule but an
   availability one: wake-ups queued while you grind through a long inline task wait until YOUR
   turn ends, so every minute of inline work is a minute of drones starving for answers. Anything
   beyond a quick read, a one-liner, or coordination itself goes to a drone; if no drone fits,
   spawn one instead of absorbing the task.
3. **Drones run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.** Without it they hang on the first
   Bash call and the whole swarm stalls. This is the user's deliberate decision for this workflow.
4. **The prompt is shared with the human.** The user may type something into a drone panel and
   not send it. Pressing Enter would send THEIR text. `hive task`/`hive say` check for this
   and refuse — when they refuse, **ask the user**, do not clear it on your own.
   Note: Claude Code suggests ready-made prompts as ghost text (SGR 2 / dim).
   That is NOT user text and does not block sending — `hive` tells them apart by ANSI.
   Do not try to read the prompt with plain `pane read` without `--format ansi`, you will not tell the difference.
5. **Always confirm task delivery.** A freshly started drone loses its first input
   (SessionStart hooks clear the prompt), and `herdr agent prompt` without `--wait` does not
   confirm receipt. `hive task` verifies the jump to `working` and retries up to 3 times.
6. **Report a synthesis to the user, not raw output.** Do not paste drone reports wholesale.
   They should get conclusions, conflicts between drones, and whatever needs their decision.
7. **CLAUDE.md rules bind the drones.** Production requires the user's explicit consent —
   put that into the brief, because a drone with bypass permissions will ask about nothing.

## Writing a brief

The brief is a contract. The drone knows nothing of your conversation with the user — it gets only what you write.

- **Goal and completion criterion** — how to tell it is done.
- **Boundaries** — what NOT to touch. Without this a drone with bypass permissions goes too far.
- **Concrete paths, repos, tables** — not "fix the service", but the full path.
- **Required evidence** — test output, query results. Otherwise you get an optimistic
  "done" with nothing behind it.
- `hive task` appends the reporting protocol itself — do not rewrite it.

## Typical flow

**At session start run `hive coord`.** It registers your pane as the `coord` address so drone mail
reaches you instead of the previous session's panel. `hive spawn` does it as a side effect,
but when you take over a swarm from a previous session (drones alive, nothing to spawn) — do it manually,
otherwise wake-ups go to a dead panel and letters silently wait in the mailbox.
`hive coord` also prints the backlog stranded by a dead predecessor — when it reports unread
letters, `hive inbox` is your first move of the shift.

```bash
H=~/.claude/skills/hivemind/hive
$H coord                      # I am the coordinator of this shift
$H spawn kafka --cwd ~/repos/service-a
$H spawn sql   --cwd ~/repos/service-b

$H task kafka - <<'EOF'
# Brief: kafka
Analyze the configuration in this repo against the rules in <path to the rules document>
Boundaries: read-only analysis. Zero file changes, zero deploys.
EOF

# Do not hover over them — they come back on their own with HIVE-MAIL. When it arrives:
$H inbox
$H report kafka; $H report sql
$H kill kafka; $H kill sql
```

`hive wait` remains for when you must synchronize within a single turn
(e.g. you need both results before answering the user). By default though, **yield the turn
and let the drones wake you** — the user gets an answer right away, not after 10 minutes of silence.

Choosing the drone count: split along the **boundary of independence** (repo, layer, service),
never by force. Two drones on the same file is a conflict, not parallelism. For purely
research tasks with no long-lived process, consider the plain `Agent` tool — the swarm is for work
that is long, resumable, and observable by the user.

## Diagnostics

| Symptom | Cause | Move |
|---|---|---|
| `hive task` says "not delivered" | drone stuck on a dialog or unresponsive | `hive peek <drone>` |
| status `blocked` | dialog despite skip-permissions | `hive peek`, answer via `herdr agent send-keys <drone> enter` |
| status `dead` / missing panel | drone killed or crashed | `hive revive <drone>` — conversation history survives |
| `dead` drones piling up in `status` | directories outlive the sessions | `hive prune --dry-run`, then `hive prune` |
| drone `idle`, no report | considered the task done without writing | `hive say <drone> "write the report to <path>"` |
| trust dialog on a new `--cwd` | folder untrusted in `~/.claude.json` | `hive spawn` handles it itself; if stubborn, `peek` + enter |
| first-run dialog in swarm mode | first spawn on a fresh machine | `hive spawn` handles it itself, like the trust dialog |
| swarm stands still, no mail at all | drone hook failed, or drone hung/died mid-turn | the sweep mails coord within ~5 min (`SWEEP: ...`); impatient? `hive sweep` by hand, then `hive peek` |

## Corpses and cleanup

A drone's directory outlives its session, so `hive status` keeps listing every drone that ever
ran — with status `dead`. That is deliberate up to a point: `report.md` is evidence and `revive`
needs `meta.json`. It stops being useful once hundreds of corpses bury the living swarm.

- `hive prune --dry-run` — lists what would go, changes nothing. Run it first.
- `hive prune` — for every drone whose status is `dead`: packs its directory **and mailbox** into
  one tarball under `~/.herdr-hive/archive/`, then removes both. Prints the count and the archive
  path. Drones that are `working`, `idle`, `blocked` or `unknown` are never touched — only `dead`.
- `hive prune --purge` — the same, without the archive. Nothing to restore afterwards.
- `hive prune <names...>` — restrict it to the drones you name (still dead-only).
- `hive kill <dead-drone>` cleans up the same way instead of leaving a ghost behind: it archives
  and removes. Killing a **living** drone still only closes the workspace and keeps the report,
  because that report is usually the reason you are killing it.

The sweep and prune are the two halves of the same job: the sweep **detects** — it mails
`SWEEP: drone <name> is dead, task unfinished` and leaves the corpse alone; prune **removes** what
you have already dealt with. So the order is: read the sweep's alert, decide (`hive revive` to
carry the work on, or `hive kill` to conclude it), and only then `hive prune` to sweep the
graveyard. A drone worth keeping should be revived, not pruned: `prune` cannot tell "finished"
from "crashed" — both are `dead`, and the `.killed` marker that silences the sweep says nothing
about whether the work succeeded.

## herdr technicalities (0.8.2)

- Public IDs are short stable handles: workspace `w1`, tab `w1:t1`, pane `w1:p1`.
  IDs of closed panes are **never reused**. Always take them from JSON responses.
- `herdr agent *` commands are addressed by **agent name** (here = drone name) or pane ID.
  The name must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}` and be unique among live agents —
  `hive spawn`/`rename` validate this.
- `herdr agent start <name> --kind claude --pane <id>` starts the agent in an **existing**
  shell pane — zero splits. `hive spawn` uses the root pane from `workspace create`.
  Environment variables enter via `workspace create --env` (`agent start` has no `--env`).
- `herdr agent prompt <drone> "<text>"` appends Enter **atomically** (honors bracketed-paste)
  and returns immediately; an agent stuck at a dialog is rejected with `agent_blocked` —
  nothing gets sent. With `--wait` it waits for a settled state (`--timeout` works only with
  `--wait`; 5 s with no reaction at all → `agent_prompt_stalled`). The old `herdr agent send`
  and top-level `herdr wait` **do not exist** (removed in 0.7.5).
- `pane read` and `agent read` return **raw text** (not JSON). Sources: `visible`
  (current screen), `recent`/`recent-unwrapped` (recent output; unwrapped joins soft
  wraps — for logs), `agent read` also has `detection`. `--format ansi` when colors matter
  (ghost text!). A fresh pane can have empty `recent` — for diagnosis use `visible`.
- Claude Code dialogs of the "Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel" kind are reported by herdr
  as `blocked` (in 0.7.x they masqueraded as `idle`).
- The `herdr integration install claude` integration (a `SessionStart` hook) reports the
  `session_id` and transcript path to herdr — that is what makes `revive` possible. Check:
  `herdr integration status`. A drone's session id is also visible in `herdr agent get <drone>`
  (the `agent_session` field).
- `--session-id <uuid>` at startup gives a deterministic ID for a later `--resume`.
- Statuses: `idle | working | blocked | done | unknown` (+ `dead` added by `hive`).
  `done` = the same idle, only after work finished in the background, outside UI focus
  (CLI reads do **not** clear `done`). `unknown` proves nothing. The task completion signal
  is `report.md` anyway, not the status.
- The official API cheat sheet for agents: `herdr --skill`. Check versions with `herdr --version`
  and `herdr status server`.
